1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
   The Python language and Flask library are easier to setup and more convenient 
    for API development. Additionally, the use of Postman for API testing helps to ensure the API is tested appropriately
    without having to worry about a frontend, while providing different data request and response format capabilities 

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
    The advantages of my solution are that its an simple logic that can be applied and run on any machine.
    The disadvantage is that it doesn't take into account concurrent attempts to modify the same data.
    For that, I plan on using threads while ensuring read-write and write-write conflicts are avoided.
3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
    In my 2nd year of bachelor's, a professor had tasked me with building an entire web application from scratch
    using Spring Boot and AngularJs. However, I was also to ensure the data is materialized. For this project, I studied
    databases, JavaScript, AngularJs, the MVC architecture, Java Beans and its transition to the polished Spring Boot framework.
    Additionally, I found it both challenging and interesting to apply relevant bits and pieces from the core topics involved
    in application development
